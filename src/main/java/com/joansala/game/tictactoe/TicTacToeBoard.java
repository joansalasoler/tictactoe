/**
 * Encapsulates the state of a tic-tac-toe match.
 *
 * A {@link Board} is an immutable object that stores all the data required
 * to represent a concrete state of a game and provides methods to convert
 * between different notations, such as from bitboards to a Forsythâ€“Edwards
 * Notation (FEN) string, or from a sequence of move identifiers to their
 * equivalent algebraic notation.
 *
 * To represent a game state, the position on the board, the player to move,
 * and any other feature that may affect the game play and/or its serialization
 * must be stored. Notice that for some games, such as Checkers, moves may be
 * encoded differently depending of the current state of the game.
 *
 * This implementation for tic-tac-toe stores the current board state as a
 * bitboard array, the player to move as an integer value, and each move as a
 * cell number from the board. See {@link TicTacToe} for the definitions.
 *
 * This {@link TicTacToeBoard} class uses the conventions defined in the
 * Universal Chess Interface to encode the board state (position) and the
 * sequences of moves as strings. That is, a board diagram is represented as
 * a FEN string, and a sequence of moves is encoded in algebraic notation.
 *
 * @see TicTacToe
 * @see UCIService
